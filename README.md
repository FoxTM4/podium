# Front End Coding Assessment

It’s worth mentioning that we care about testing our code here at Podium, and it would be beneficial for you to demonstrate how you test in the challenge as well.

Shakespeare has been getting a lot of reviews recently about his plays. So far he has managed to build a backend API to serve them, but he doesn’t have the chops to finish out the UI. That’s where you come in, your task is to build a client side app for Shakespeare’s API. The **design** of the application is up to you.

### API Documentation

**Authentication:**

- Authentication is done by passing your API token using the **x-api-key** header. The value of this header will contain nothing more than just the token value.
- Your authentication token is: ```H3TM28wjL8R4#HTnqk?c```

**Endpoints:**

Two endpoints exist for this API.

1. **Reviews Index**

    - **GET** [https://shakespeare.podium.com/api/reviews](https://shakespeare.podium.com/api/reviews)
    - Response looks like this:

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
